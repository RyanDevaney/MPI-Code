This folder is the project folder for PA03 - Bucket Sort.
To run the sequential version of bucket sort, make the file using make. Then run it using sbatch sequential.sh
Currently the data.txt file is holding 10 billion numbers ranging from 0 to 10000. In order to generate a different data file with
a different amount of numbers run the generator executable with ./generator. This will prompt the user to imput a different set
of numbers that the user can specify the amount.
