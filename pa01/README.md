This is the directory for Project 1, Ping Pong.

In order to run the code, use make to compile the source files in the folder src.
Next run the programs using sbatch.
There are three programs that can be run: One_box.sh, Two_box.sh, and Timing.sh.
The output will be placed into a file with the same naming convention as the .sh files. 
For example, the output file of One_box.sh will be one_box.out
An example of how to run a program after it has been made is shown here: "sbatch One_box.sh".
