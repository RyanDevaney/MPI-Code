This is the project folder for PA04-Matrix Multiplication
To compile the project use make. In order to run the program use sbatch sequential.sh. In order to change the size of the file go into
the .sh file and change the number to the size you want. Note that this program only works for square matrix sizes. 

To run the parallel code use make to make the file and parallel.sh to run it. In the .sh file you can either put a number as the size of the matrices, or add 2 files that the program will be able to to open and get data from.
